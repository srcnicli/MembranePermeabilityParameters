# MembranePermeabilityParameters
Transport processes in equine oocytes and ovarian tissue during loading with cryoprotective solutions


Membrane permeability of oocytes to water (Lp) and to CPAs (Ps) was inferred from video microscopic imaging of oocyte volume responses during perfusion with anisotonic and CPA solutions. CPA diffusion into ovarian tissue and tissue dehydration was monitored during incubation, using osmometer and weight measurements, to derive CPA diffusion coefficients (D).

1.) All matlab files (.mlx) and excel file should be in the same directory. 

2.) Volume and time data are obtained with video microscopic imaging.

3.) Normalized raw volume data and time data are written to the specified places on the page named Re-analyze in the excel file. (Parameter descriptions and units can be found in the excel file.)

4.) By running the main code, the water and solution permeability of the cell is calculated and the fitting graph is obtained.
